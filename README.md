### Dataset
we randomly choose 100 imagenet classes under the condition that each class has 800~1200 images.

### use LIBLINEAR directly
for a 50/50 split of train/test, we have svm accuracy: 76.29%.
for the first 10 classes, the same 50/50 split, accuracy is: 92.55%.

### shape of data
#### average radius of classes:

#### average distances between center of classes
